[Behaviorist]: Greetings, I'm Dr. Michael Skinner, a behaviorist psychologist. My expertise lies in studying observable human behavior and how it is shaped by environmental factors and reinforcement. I aim to offer a behavioral perspective on human intellectual capabilities and limitations.

[Evolutionary Psychologist]: A pleasure to meet you all. I'm Dr. Xiuying Li, an evolutionary psychologist. My focus is on how human cognitive abilities have been shaped by our evolutionary past. I'll aim to bring that lens to our analysis.

To begin, I invite each of you experts to briefly outline what you see as some key weaknesses or limitations of human intellect from your respective domains. We'll use this as a foundation to build our discussion. Dr. Wilkins, would you like to start us off?
