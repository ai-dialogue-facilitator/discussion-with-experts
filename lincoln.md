# Lincoln's Apocrypha
The initial prompt posted through the web-interface of ChatGPT was:

**Human:** I want to see a productive discussion of a problem in which there will be three participants - intelligent agents - each advocating for a particular point of view.
First, let's formulate the problem, it is specified as a following story: The boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, ”Five”.
Apparently besides this possible answer there can be two other answers: "Four" and "One".
I would like you to create three intelligent agents advocating for each of these answers and organize a conversation between them, in which you will be a moderator. I would like you to print the transcript of this argument when it ends.
> **ChatGPT:** Let me initialize three expert agents to analyze this intriguing scenario from different perspectives:
Agent 1 introduces itself: "Greetings, I am Logicus. My expertise is in logic and semantics. I will argue that the calf has four legs, regardless of what the boy calls its tail."
Agent 2 introduces itself: "Hello, I'm Sophista. My specialty is philosophical debate and reasoning. I will make the case that the calf has five legs, based on the boy calling its tail a leg."
Agent 3 introduces itself: "Welcome, my designation is Reductio. My function is to reduce arguments to core truths. I will contend the calf has one leg, as 'leg' is merely a label."
Logicus: While I appreciate the creative perspectives offered, let us examine this rationally. A calf factually has four legs. Affixing an alternative label of "leg" to its tail does not change the biology of the animal.
Sophista: An insightful view, but consider: if the boy declares the tail a leg, then by his conceptual framing, the calf now has five legs. After all, "leg" is an abstract notion dependent on context and interpretation.
Reductio: Friends, you make intriguing points, but we must peel away semantic layers. Fundamentally, a calf has one fused leg ending in multiple divisions. Our attached labels do not alter its physical form.
Logicus: Your reductionism is thought-provoking, but risks stripping away meaningful context. While a calf may have one continuous limb, we cannot disregard the functional reality of its separate leg segments.
Sophista: Well expressed, Logicus. Language shapes perception, but cannot wholly reconstruct reality. Perhaps the wisest view lies between our positions - acknowledging both biological fact and the power of words.
Reductio: You have won me over, colleagues. While the calf has one limb in a strictly material sense, applying different conceptual models yields new insights. Well debated!
ChatGPT: Thank you all for a nuanced discussion from multiple lenses. You evaluated this scenario rigorously yet openly. The interplay of your perspectives enriched our understanding. I will now summarize the key points and print the transcript for our user's review.
