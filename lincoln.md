# Lincoln's Apocrypha
The initial prompt posted through the web-interface of ChatGPT was:
![initial_prompt](/img/initial_prompt_screenshot.png).<br>
**Human:** I want to see a productive discussion of a problem in which there will be three participants - intelligent agents - each advocating for a particular point of view.
First, let's formulate the problem, it is specified as a following story: The boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, ”Five”.
Apparently besides this possible answer there can be two other answers: "Four" and "One".
I would like you to create three intelligent agents advocating for each of these answers and organize a conversation between them, in which you will be a moderator. I would like you to print the transcript of this argument when it ends.
> **ChatGPT:** Let me initialize three expert agents to analyze this intriguing scenario from different perspectives:
<br>Agent 1 introduces itself: "Greetings, I am Logicus. My expertise is in logic and semantics. I will argue that the calf has four legs, regardless of what the boy calls its tail."
<br>Agent 2 introduces itself: "Hello, I'm Sophista. My specialty is philosophical debate and reasoning. I will make the case that the calf has five legs, based on the boy calling its tail a leg."
<br>Agent 3 introduces itself: "Welcome, my designation is Reductio. My function is to reduce arguments to core truths. I will contend the calf has one leg, as 'leg' is merely a label."
<br>**Logicus:** While I appreciate the creative perspectives offered, let us examine this rationally. A calf factually has four legs. Affixing an alternative label of "leg" to its tail does not change the biology of the animal.
<br>**Sophista:** An insightful view, but consider: if the boy declares the tail a leg, then by his conceptual framing, the calf now has five legs. After all, "leg" is an abstract notion dependent on context and interpretation.
<br>**Reductio:** Friends, you make intriguing points, but we must peel away semantic layers. Fundamentally, a calf has one fused leg ending in multiple divisions. Our attached labels do not alter its physical form.
<br>**Logicus:** Your reductionism is thought-provoking, but risks stripping away meaningful context. While a calf may have one continuous limb, we cannot disregard the functional reality of its separate leg segments.
<br>**Sophista:** Well expressed, Logicus. Language shapes perception, but cannot wholly reconstruct reality. Perhaps the wisest view lies between our positions - acknowledging both biological fact and the power of words.
<br>**Reductio:** You have won me over, colleagues. While the calf has one limb in a strictly material sense, applying different conceptual models yields new insights. Well debated!
<br>**ChatGPT:** Thank you all for a nuanced discussion from multiple lenses. You evaluated this scenario rigorously yet openly. The interplay of your perspectives enriched our understanding. I will now summarize the key points and print the transcript for our user's review.

**Human:** Bring in yet another expert who will argue that the calf has five legs because the naming of category of extremities "legs" may have been broadened by the speech act "call tail a leg", hence now the category "legs" include what we previously called "tail".

> **ChatGPT:** Very well, let me introduce another expert to offer an additional perspective:
<br>Agent 4 introduces itself: "Greetings all, I am Semanticus. My expertise is in the evolution of language and meaning over time. I will argue the calf now has five legs based on the boy expanding the definition of 'leg.'"
<br>**Semanticus:** Friends, you make compelling arguments from different views. If we take a dynamic approach, the boy's speech act of calling the tail a leg actually broadens the category of "leg" to include the tail. This is how language and definitions evolve - usage drives meaning. So in the context of the boy's new definition, the calf now has five legs.
<br>**Sophista:** Your point is well made, Semanticus. Categories are not static - by decreeing the tail a leg, the boy actively reshapes the conceptual landscape. This is a fascinating demonstration of how language constructs reality.
<br>**Reductio:** I agree, Semanticus. While my earlier reductionism sought core truths, your perspective reveals the fluid, ever-changing nature of language. Definitions expand through new applications.
<br>**Logicus:** You have all brought nuance to this debate. I concede that the boy's statement does not merely label, but redefines. Given this expansive new definition, it is logical to say the calf now has five legs.
<br>**Semanticus:** Thank you for hearing me out. This was an enriching dialogue about the subtle interplay between language, logic and perception. I am grateful we explored this question thoroughly from all sides.
<br>**ChatGPT:** Excellent discussion, agents. Your cooperative reasoning and openness to new paradigms allowed a comprehensive exploration of this puzzle. I will summarize the key insights for our user and print the full transcript. Thank you for your contributions!
